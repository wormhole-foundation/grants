# 🏁 Mission

The Wormhole Foundation xGrant Program is primarily for software development and research focused on cross-chain protocols and use cases.

Our average grant size is range is based on the complexity and necessary resourcing. Larger funding requests will require more evaluation and due diligence — hence the longer decision time.

Announcements about receiving an xGrant can only be made once the 1st milestone is accepted. Teams shouldn't seek to cover 100% of their funding via the Wormhole xGrant Program.

# 📝 Guidelines

We are focused on funding projects that continue to push cross-chain connectivity. These are the general guidelines for grant applications:
- It’s a well-researched and/or well-tested idea, ideally **with a proof-of-concept** or prior work to demonstrate feasibility.
- The team shall demonstrate how the project will be **deployed, maintained and operated** after completion of the grant, through commitment of funding, its tokenomics, or other business models.
- It shall demonstrate how the project can/will **specifically benefit** the Wormhole network and/or its ecosystem, both technologically and economically.
- The team has **proven experience** and a track record for solid delivery.
- It contains well-defined technical details.
- It presents how your project is **differentiated** from comparable products in the ecosystem or in other comparable ecosystems.
- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced.

# 🚦The Process
## 📜 1. Application

[Apply here](https://forms.clickup.com/45049775/f/1aytxf-2230/JTHWNTS51O03DJYO9Z). Please discuss with us if you are unsure of any aspect of the application. You can contact us at xgrants@wormholenetwork.com

## 🔍 2. Review and Decision

The Wormhole Foundation committee will review your application and determine if additional information is required. Once a decision is made, the application team will be notified, and follow-ups will be arranged.

## ✔️ 3. Milestone Deliverables

Milestone deliverables shall be submitted via email to xgrants@wormholenetwork.com and follow the guidelines below:

- **Code completeness**: please ensure submitted milestone contains a complete codebase that is compilable and runnable.
- **Tests**: provide step-by-step guide to demonstrate how the code achieves the milestone. It should contain unit, integration, and user acceptance tests (steps to perform actions on a mobile/web app if applicable).
- **Deployment and running application (if applicable)**: provide step-by-step guide to deploy and run the contracts, protocols and application programs.
- **License**: be sure to include the license for each repo.
- **Documentation**: provide documentation for APIs, architecture and an overview of the project, algorithms and mechanisms of the protocols, tutorials, and articles that articulate using the protocols and applications.
- **List each milestone deliverable**: provide enough details e.g. links to specific code/repo location, documentation, and guide so that we can easily verify the deliverables against the original application.

## 📣 4. Announcement Guidelines

We demand xGrant teams only make announcements after the first milestone has been accepted. This is to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the announcement to raise funds or create hype but don't intend to deliver, deploy, and operate on the project. We reserve the right to terminate grants if these guidelines are violated.

The following are guidelines for announcement:

- It should focus on the **technology** and **products** being developed and/or deployed rather than pure a marketing announcement.
- Ideally it should include a demonstration of the product and a guide for users and/or developers to use it.
- It should include links to the Github repo and deployed website/app.
- Dos/Don'ts of language in the announcement:
    - Do NOT use terms like `partner`, `partnership`, `affiliate` that implies a relationship between the two entities due to the nature of the Wormhole network.
    - Do NOT indicate Wormhole prefers a certain technology over others, as both are open platforms.

We look forward to building the multichain future with you!
